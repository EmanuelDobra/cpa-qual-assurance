# Agile Handout
## Introduction to Agile (video)
### Traditional Project
- Plan (make a perfect plan)
- Build (follow plan to the letter)
- Testing (check the build follows the original plan)
> Why did this change? Because changes / requirements change, and you can't continue with the old plan. They are called waterfall projects
### Agile Project
- Plan (simple plans, concise)
    - Specify the problem in a way the user can understand
    - Assures everyone stays focused on important things
- Build
    - We begin by building very small and simple things
    - Deliver something early (simplistic), you'll have something to show
- Testing
    - Test, and test, and test, over and over again

> The charm of agile projects is that you do all 3 stages over and over again. We create small plans, then build small things, then test those small things, then repeat until the project finishes. It's an iterative development.
#### Backlog
How do you manage requirements? With a backlog:
- A collection of stories
    - Each story in the backlog can describe a feature or something less important
    - The key thing is that the backlog is prioritized
        - Do the really valuable stuff first, and leave the less valuable near the end
- Always prepared that something will go wrong
- Backlog grooming: Managing the backlog
> The system you intend to build at the start of the project will likely be very different from the one you have when the project ends, which is a good thing, because by the end of the project you'll have a better idea of what the system needs to do. Also helps if due dates change, as you know you'll have something of value no matter the time.

## Agile
```
Agile is a set of values and principles. The concept has been applied in many fields: sales, marketing, finance, HR. In our field, it is a software development methodology. That is, a way of implementing the software development life cycle. Agile’s main goals are to deliver quality software faster and to adapt to changing circumstances. This is done in an iterative way,  continually repeating three phases of the life cycle: design, code and test. Agile results are often better aligned with client needs. There is a higher level of engagement by staff and a higher level of client satisfaction. Problems are identified early. There are no hard fast rules or standards for Agile. Companies implement agile whatever way they like, picking and choosing the parts they like. For this reason, agile can vary greatly at different organizations
```
## Agile Teams
```
The development team may be made up of graphic designers, coders and testers. 
The development team may be made up of graphic designers, coders and testers. 
The goal is to leverage each individual’s strengths and learn from others
A developer chooses what to work on and estimates how long it will take. 
If the developer cannot estimate the time accurately then the task (story) is not well described or is too large. 
```
## Sprint
```
An agile project’s life cycle is made up of sprints. Each sprint involves three stages of the SDLC: plan, build and test. A sprint is typically 2 or 3 or 4 weeks long. Every sprint ends with:
-	A completed deliverable. This means the client has a usable product at all times. 
-	The product owner checking in with the client. Are we doing the right thing? Is it what you wanted?
-   Sprint burdown graph: highlights the progress made in the sprint and the progress remaning
-   Retrospective: What went well VS Areas of improvement (last step of sprint, then sprint restarts until customers and owner are satisfied)
Examples of a deliverable: storyboard, user interface with no meat behind it, the first 3 high priority features. 
```
## Scrum
```
A scrum is a daily, fast paced, stand up meeting where team members report on work completed since last meeting, obstacles that arose and upcoming tasks.

In order for a scrum to work, it requires: Collaboration, Communication, Cadence
- Entire team joins
- Same time every day
- Just an overview not progress report
- Daily opportunity to ask your help
Stories | Not Started | In Progress | Done

Discusision: 
- What did you do yesterday
- What are you going to do today
- Is anything blocking your progress
```
## Business Requirements (Sustainable Energy)
### Application
Sustainable Energy Home Improvements App
> Allows homeowners to find, view, explore, purchase, rent, try and build any kind of renewable energy home systems that would allow them to analyze their existing electricity use and plan ahead to replace/implement new technologies that will facilitate them into turning the majority of their electricity usage from owned renewable devices instead of it being provided by the outside world.

### Buisiness Requirements
```
These are big picture features for the software you would like designed. It needs to be very specific to your environmental application. Give each feature a title and a one or two sentence description. 
The development team needs to understand what you want. If you are not clear in your description, they won’t know how to write the code. They may even build an application very different than the one you wanted. Try to cover multiple aspects of the software. Write the features from the client’s perspective. Think like a client who is not a programmer. 

Example:
business requirements for a children’s store application. Notice there is no mention of programming language, server, database, code etc
-	Provide the user with photos and descriptions of all toys available both in the store and on line.
-	 Create a custom clothing feature.
o	Users can enter their child’s measurement and have a piece of clothing custom made.
o	Present users will a sample piece of clothing. The user can modify the look by selecting short vs long sleeves, shorts vs long pants, print vs plain fabric. The user is shown an image of the new look.
-	Create a rent a swag feature where children’s clothing is loaned out.
-	Create a shopping basket where users can purchase toys using a credit card.

```
### Our Group Requirements
- User friendly design
    - Easy to access all features
    - Non-crowded controls
- Tooltips and Descriptions for all actions
- User support
    - FAQ easily accessible
    - Form where users can post their own questions
    - 24/7 smart AI available for common issues
- Provide user with a simple but efficient search system that explores the database of all possible devices for renewable energy
    - Allow users to post their own personal devices, share their blueprints, or sell them depending on what they choose
    - Identify Official devices pages with a verified checkmark so that users can know which sources can be trusted and which need personall investigation
- Renewable energy devices shop
    - Rent feature  
    - Return policy
- Virtual field where the user can recreate their home environment and would be able to theoretically test any devices they wish to buy, in order to see how useful they would be
    - Create a virtual custom renewable energy device feature that the user can then test in virtualized enviroments that they specify 
- Suggest to users the most economically and environmentally friendly devices based on their location and address

# Internet on Fire (video)
- Free lunch? Run.
- Smart? More like exploitable. 

# Lessons From James Bach Handout
## Lessons
- The lesson is don’t trust what you are given. 
- Verify with the developers that you know exactly what is wanted.
- Especially when directions are given verbally.  
- We are not in the belief business. 
- We are in the observation and inference business. 
- Belief is a sin for testers.
## Context
```
It is important to check context before giving technical answers. Testers are there to catch as many situations as possible. Testing is exploration. Test the product to learn how it might not work. All three areas in the Venn diagram below are important for testers. 

A testers job is to compare actual to described. The tester must also be aware that the described is only a slice of the world they must cope with. 
```

## Your To Do List As A Tester  
```
Human testing involves skill, emotion and intelligence that cannot be automated. Automated testing cannot use judgement, cannot learn and cannot evolve. 
```
### As a tester, you need to:
- Think laterally.
- Think vertically.
- Learn things quickly.
- Become excellent at asking questions.
- Model products in your mind.
- Respond to those models.
> Testing is for intellectual, rapid learners who love to solve problems.
















the Beverly Hills Country Club was a
nightclub and a restaurant a huge one it
could seat up to 3,000 people every
single night people who would come to
enjoy multi-course dinners and watch
first-class entertainment on the 28th of
May in 1977 a 19-year old guy called
Walter Bailey was working at the Beverly
Hills Country Club as a waiter and
around 8 o'clock that evening
Walter was stopped by another waiter who
asked Walter if if he knew where the
owners of the club are and Walter didn't
and he asked why and the other waiter
told him that there's a small electrical
fire in one of the rooms in the center
of the complex so he's trying to find
the owner a Walter got interested and he
decided to investigate so he left his
ballroom where he was serving and he
went to the center of the Country Club
towards the room which had the fire and
as he was getting closer to this room he
could see that they were smoke pouring
out from the top of the door that led
through the room so he realized that
there's a big fire inside the room and
he was clever enough not to open the
door instead he returned back to his
ballroom the complex had multiple
different ball rolls and the one where
he was serving in had over 900 people
seated down so he went there and he
found his boss and he told his boss that
there's a fire in the building and we
have to evacuate this room and his boss
was just looking at him blankly and now
you have to understand there were 900
people seated down there and these
people were celebrating
rating things like their weddings there
were multiple wedding parties in the
audience like Brides in their wedding
dresses there were people celebrating
their 50th anniversaries or 50 birthdays
with their families watching
entertainment and drinking and enjoying
the food and then Walter saw that there
was actually a queue of people who were
still coming into the room so he went to
the queue and he told them that
everybody follow me and then he walked
this queue to different corridors out
from the complex to the Courtyard and he
told them please wait here and nobody
didn't even ask him why they were just
following orders but as Walter returned
to his ballroom to his horror he saw
that everybody was still sitting down
the band was still playing people were
still ordering cocktails and then he
decided to act he thought to himself
that I'm going to get into trouble over
this but nevertheless he climbed to the
stage he took the microphone from the
singer of the band he told the band to
stop and then he addressed the crowd he
told the crowd that everybody listen up
if you look on your right side there's
an exit in the wall over there if you
look on your left side there's an exit
in the wall over there and in the back
there's one more exit everybody stand up
right now and leave the room and that's
what people did they followed orders and
that night the kensic Country Club
burned to the ground the ballroom that
Walter the 19 year-old Walter evacuated
was engulfed in flames in 10 minutes
from the moment when he took the mic
Walter saved hundreds of people there
were other people in the complex we
weren't so lucky over 165 people died
that night in that fire but that story
reminds me of our own actions today in
our lives today in our digital lives
today because our lives are moving
more and more to the online world now we
are seeing things going wrong in our
online world and very few people are
taking action and we hear a lot of
thought talks about things like the big
brother or big brother Society but I'd
like to actually quote a late footer
ologist and a fellow Finn my commander
mom who in his books wrote a lot about
the future and he wrote about how he
actually doesn't believe in a Big
Brother Society he's sort of more
believing that we will be entering a
some brother society a society where
there's always someone watching not
necessarily the Big Brother not
necessarily the government but someone
and he also made the note that we are
leaving an aquarium life where we have
no walls or we have walls but they can
be seen through now some of this some
other watching mentality can be seen
from the actual action of governments
for example during just this year in our
labs at f-secure we've analyzed five
malware families which we believe to be
coming from the russian government while
we're like sand worm and cosmic goof
which have mostly been found from
ukraine where which is a country in the
middle of crisis right now or malware
like Harvick's which is the first
malware we've seen since
Stuxnet that's actually trying to find
and fingerprint factory automation gear
and we believe these are coming from the
russian government and then we have the
chinese government in fact the very
first targeted attacks launched by any
government anywhere in the world we ever
saw we're coming from the chinese
government and that was more than ten
years ago and exactly a year ago i was
on this very stage speaking to you about
the tax right here in brussels about
attacks targeting local telcos attack
that we now understand much better a
year later we understand them much
better for example we now know exactly
where these attacks were coming from
they were coming from the UK
intelligence from GCHQ we also know
which exact malware was being used in
these attacks it's a piece of malware
called regin which we believe was
developed together with the british
intelligence and the u.s. intelligence
and we learn much more about the targets
of these attacks because they were they
were they were much more targets than
just when we knew a year ago we for
example know that this malware and these
operations launched by the UK
intelligence we're targeting academics
here in Belgium professors people like
that they were also targeting targets in
Austria including the IAEA the
International atom energy agency in
Austria now we also know that one of the
largest amount of targets anywhere in
the world were in Ireland which is a
good indication of who's behind the
attacks and who's interested in Ireland
well United Kingdom is interested in
Ireland
and it's quite remarkable when we have a
situation like this where fellow EU
countries are launching active
governmental funded malware attacks
against fellow EU countries but that's
where we are today but there are parties
which are trying to fight back the u.s.
government try to gain access to the
data of several of the Silicon Valley
companies a couple of years ago one of
the companies was Yahoo Yahoo tried to
fight back those attacks and these
attacks are actually very similar to the
attacks we've been seeing just now in
Germany this guy is a leaf RS he works
for a company called Stiller which is a
German telco company German
telecommunications provider which
provides connectivity over satellite
links
they're Spiegel magazine did an
investigation in which they found out
that once again the British intelligence
had been breaching telcos in Europe in
this case the network of stiller so here
we have a video clip of the Der Spiegel
journalist going and meeting engineers
at this stellar company and showing them
files leaked by Edward Snowden files
which prove that still are their own
company has been targeted and hacked by
British intelligence they are now seeing
for the very first time this slide which
lists their own company among the
targets which have been hacked by UK
intelligence agencies then they are
shown another slide which lists the
target stock the names of the engineers
in the company they see their own names
listed in this top secret file they just
now realize that they personally have
been hacked so returning back to Yahoo
Yahoo tried to fight the US government
they didn't want to give access to their
customers data and this fight was
happening in a secret court there are
such things secret court in United
States the so called
FISA Court or Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act Court in which a lawyer
from Yahoo was trying to defend the
users of Yahoo against the US government
the judge is in the court made
interesting comments for example one of
the judges was claiming that they could
could possibly be no damage to the
customers of Yahoo since this
surveillance will be secret which means
the customers will not know that they
are being watched so how could possibly
they have any damage because they will
not know that they are being watched and
he was actually right this actually
stood based on the US law and Yahoo's
case was thrown out and this was then
used as a legal precedence to do similar
surveillance against
other silicon valley-based companies as
well so let me quote a friend of mine
our el balcón from Indy Tech he made a
great comment about how private used to
mean something completely different
private used to mean something where you
would go with your friend just the two
of you where there's no one else and you
would speak in private that's what it
used to me well today in the online
world private doesn't mean that for
example when you're on Facebook and you
send a private message you don't
actually send it to someone else you
give it to Facebook and Facebook gives
it to your friend this is sort of like
you would tell your private message to
your creepy uncle and then the creepy
uncle would tell it to your friend right
that's the equivalent and the largest
creepy uncle we have on the net is
Google Google who sees exactly what
we're doing what we're thinking Google
who provides excellent and great
services we all use them and what's even
better these services are free which is
remarkable when you consider how big a
company Google is and how expensive
their operations are in fact Google
spends every quarter roughly two billion
dollars into their data centers they're
investing every quarter over two billion
in the building larger and larger data
centers yet the services that they
provide are free and what's even more
remarkable Google is profitable they
make 12 billion dollars profit every
year which nicely illustrates that there
is no such a thing as free that's how
valuable our data is to Google there are
no free lunches there are no free search
engines there are no free cloud storages
there are no free webmail the only
things on the net which really and truly
are free are things like you know Linux
kernel like open source projects most of
the things which are called free are not
free
for example apps there are no free apps
we know that all the app stores are
filled with free apps none of them are
free and you see this when you go and
download something simple you know an
application which will turn your phone
into a flashlight or a torch and then
when you take a closer look on what kind
of rights or permissions it requires
from your handset it wants to know your
location and gain access to your
contacts and and to the Internet of
course why would a flashlight need that
there is no free lunch there are no free
apps so it's easy to blame the user the
users are making stupid mistakes I had a
good story about users about this guy
who had an old desktop computer at his
work and he got a new computer so he
wanted to move his files from the old
computer to new computer so what he did
is that he he went to his My Documents
folder and with his mouse he selected
all his files then he right clicked a
selected topic then he disconnected the
mouse from the computer connected in the
new computer and click paste and that's
not a stupid user let's actually have
obviously a very smart man who simply
hasn't had the training I mean it could
work like that
it just doesn't and another thing users
do is is that they lie what is the
biggest lie on the Internet
well the biggest lie on the Internet is
that I have read and I agree to the
License Agreement we all do this we know
you all do this because we actually
tested this we set up a free Wi-Fi
hotspot in London earlier this year so
you got free access to our Wi-Fi hooks
but but of course you had to read
through the end-user license agreement
to get the access and in our license
agreement we had a slight clause which
said that you will have to give your
first point child to us
and everybody clicked okay now we didn't
actually go and pick up the firstborn
Charles I think we really shoot out you
know go through the doors and hello
we've come to pick up Jamie we didn't do
that and we have to accept the license
agreements today even when we use our
devices well like our smart washing
machines or smart doorbells or our smart
TVs let me tell you a secret when you
hear that the machine is smart but it
actually means that it's exploitable
smart means exploitable Smart TV means
an exploitable TV smartphone means an
exploitable phone and so on that's what
it means and these devices when you go
and read their license agreements have
surprising things so for example the
Samsung Smart TV explains to you that
this voice recognition feature in your
TV will record what you speak around the
TV so please be aware that if your
spoken words include personal or
sensitive information it will be
recorded by your television in your
living room or if you're playing a game
of football with your xbox and if you
happen to swear when the computer scores
against you it will actually record you
swearing in your living room and will
give you warnings because you swear in
your living room this is sort of like
having the creepy uncles in our gaming
consoles and inside our television sets
we are living in a quarry of life or a
great thing that happened with the new
iPhone which now has this health app
which tracks your health and one user
note they said he was tracking his steps
so he asked a question online like okay
it's counting my step I actually never
enabled this how do i how do I stop my
phone from counting my steps and the
answer was that actually it's been
counting your steps already from iPhone
for s it just never showed it to you
before and obviously if it hasn't been a
problem to you before how come it's a
problem now and there's no way to
disable it and there are people who will
tell you that there's nothing you could
do about these things there's nothing
that could be done so you shouldn't even
try to do anything at all
and I don't believe in that I believe
that when we see things going wrong we
should stop and even though we might
think that this will get into us trouble
we should act I hope we have the
strength and guts to act I hope I have
the strength and guts to act I hope you
have the strength and the guts to act
when things go wrong I hope you have the
strength and guts to think that this
will get me into trouble
but when needed I hope you are the one
who will stop the band and grab the
microphone thank you very much
