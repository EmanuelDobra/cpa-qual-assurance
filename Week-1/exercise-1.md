Scenario: your consulting company just received a new contract to provide user support for an internet/intranet based application. The application has been running successfully for three years. The application runs on web enabled laptops. A client calls to report that their laptop has been using this application without problems for 6 months. It stopped working today. Think about what you need to know to help this user. Think about what questions you need to ask to provide context. List 3 - 5 unique questions. The best 3 will be graded. The questions you write down should not be the same theme.
```

1. Does the application have a subscription system that might of ran out after those 6 months?
2. List all that the client has done on the laptop within the period of their last successful use of our application until today when they reported the issue.
3. What does the client mean when they say that the application stopped working? Specify which parts or features do not work anymore.
4. Are there any error messages that the client has received?
5. Are there any outside issues surrounding the client, such as the loss of internet, that could of caused this issue.
