## Unit Testing vs System Testing
- Unit testing is typically done by the developpers / programmers
- System testers, they will test that report and other proccesses around them.
    - More data, more test cases 

## The first phase in testing
- is the key phase
- how much time you spend on it is very important

## Environment setup
- Clone what is in the actual app
- test on a small but significant data

## SQL
- querying the database
- make sure data is valid through the end
- logging + analyzing test results
    - flag errors
- packaging test results to obtain client sign off
- Everything is monitored and edited at the end of the day

## System Testing Deliverables
- Plans to execute
- Possible text cases with outcomes
- Test cases
- Right Data
- Testing Checks 
- Testing defects
    - Always there, missinterpratations from client side, etc
    - Correct before implementation
    
## Skillset for testers
- Analysis
- Early phase in the testing lifecycle
- Get familiar with test cases
    - generate new if needed
- Written and oral communication skills importance
- Technical skills (sql, orace, db2, jcl, cobol,)
    - Testers don't modify the code but have a good understanding of it
- These skills are transferable between developers and system testers

## Testing in the SDLC
- Functionality
- Regression
- Test program after changes
- Performance
- Automation
- User Acceptance
    - Very important especially for frontend
- Done by developers, system testers and clients (user acceptance testing)
    - System testers are invovled in the early stages, analyss through to implemantation

## Testing at MOHLTC
- 20+ sys testers 
    - juniors to senior leads
        - Systems officer classifications
        - From sys tester to project leaders
- nothing implemented until it goes through sys testing as well as user acceptance testing, post implementation testing, etc
- this allows to minimize risk of impacting production

## Types of position
- 20 
- entry level positions

## Interivew
- they ask you what you want to do
- "test" questions you have to answer
- 20-30mins
